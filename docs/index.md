## Anomaly Runner

Escalations/expeditions are found by running combat anomaly sites in high security space. The first fit below can be used in all high security space combat sites including hideaways, refugees and dens that may escalate to DED 3 to 5 sites.

The fit uses sensor boosters to increase the locking speed and help run this easy sites faster and entropic radiation sink to increase the damage. Alternatively one of the radiation sinks can be replaced by a sensor booster (e.g. F-89) to further increase the locking speed. This also helps when running a contested anomally. The fit can also be used for class 3 anomalies.

The second fit can be used to run the escalations up to DED 4 with ease. DED 5 is also possible but needs a bit of care.

## C3 Warmhole

Same idea here, replacing the armor hardeners for multispectrum energized membranes.
