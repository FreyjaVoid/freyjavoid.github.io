## Vedmak High Security Anomaly Finder

Escalations/expeditions are found by running combat anomaly sites in high security space. The fit below can be used in all high security space combat sites including hideaways, refugees and dens that may escalate to DED 3 to 5 sites.

The fit uses sensor boosters to increase the locking speed and help run this easy sites faster and entropic radiation sink to increase the damage. Alternatively one of the radiation sinks can be replaced by a sensor booster to further increase the locking speed. This also helps when running a contested anomally.
